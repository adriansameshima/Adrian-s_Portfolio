## [Project 1: Kings County House Sales Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/KingCountyHouseSalesDashboard_16976699907880/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

*This project is a Tableau Dashboard I created in order to organize and show House sales in King's County which is located in Washington State

*The data was retrieved from Kaggle and it shows the values from 2014-15

*I organized the dashboard with filters and various charts plus a map to represent the information from the dataset

*My goal is for the user to be able to have a better understanding of the sales of houses that happened in King's County by playing around with the dashboard and changing some attributes and filters
